Challenge 1: Customize ðŸŽ¨

https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/create-json-rest-api#challenge-1-customize-


Customize the REST API. Can you turn the thing resource into something you would actually want to create a server around?

You could use the dictionary example from our first week, or TODOs, or a game, or virtual currency! Whatever you like, this is your REST API!

Be sure to give the resource some additional properties other than a name!
